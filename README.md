# Monte_Carlo_Simulator
A project to help display the power of monte carlo simulations! 

With a couple of assumptions of course, we can simulate the potential value of a portfolio over some period of time. Assuming returns are normally distirbuted and the the expected return and volatility of a given portfolio are constant (a far cry from the truth of course), we create of dsitribution of expected terminal values for some given amount invested. 

You can adjusted the starting value of the portfolio, expected return, risk, and yearly spending.

All visualizations are displayed on both a nominal and real basis.
